## Project description and objective

This analysis was based on a set of data from a survey conducted by Google to a group of 200 students from different majors in the United States. The objective of this analysis is to find the most relevant insights and data that the information brings to obtain a general overview of how the students' mental health is, what are the most relevant aspects and important issues to take into account.

## Data preparation and processing

In the preparation of this analysis project, the necessary metrics were determined to conduct the study. The database was located, downloaded, and subsequently securely and systematically organized on the computer. Additionally, a version control repository was created to ensure the security of the information.

For data processing, a thorough cleaning procedure was conducted, focusing on identifying erroneous or inaccurately entered data and removing any duplicated information. Additionally, outliers were identified and handled appropriately to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the dataset. Data normalization and transformation techniques were applied as needed to prepare the data for analysis. 

This is a list of the specific actions that were carried out. More detailed information can be found in the project code.

* Import datasets specifying separator
* Remove rows with missing values 
* Clean column names
* Remove empty spaces
* Review and correct the data type of each column
* Hide columns that would not be relevant for the analysis.
* Filter some columns to omit zero values
* Rename columns


## Analysis and conclusions

The following conclusions were reached through information extraction via SQL:

* Overall, the majors with the highest number of mental health conditions are Engineering, Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT), Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS), and Psychology.

* Regarding Depression, Anxiety, and Panic Attacks, the percentage of students experiencing these conditions is around 35%, 34%, and 33%, respectively.

* On average, only 20% of students with conditions receive professional treatment. 80% do not receive any kind of professional treatment or support.

* The first year of study has the highest number of people with mental health conditions.

* The average age of students with mental health conditions is 20 years.

* Women represent the largest percentage of individuals with mental health conditions compared to men.

* Overall, the largest percentage of students with mental health conditions have a General Academic Average (CGPA) between 3.5 and 4.
